# 🔥 Real-Time Fire Detection System

🚒 A real-time fire detection system built with **Python**, **Streamlit**, and the **YOLOv8 model**.  
This project uses computer vision to detect fire in video streams and live camera feeds, making it useful for **safety monitoring, surveillance, and disaster prevention**.  

---

## ✨ Features
- 🧠 **YOLOv8 Model** for accurate fire detection  
- 🎥 Works with **live webcam feed** or uploaded videos  
- ⚡ **Real-time inference** with minimal latency  
- 🌐 Interactive **Streamlit web interface**  
- 📊 Easy-to-understand results with bounding boxes and confidence scores

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- 🐍 Python  
- 🤖 YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)  
- 🎨 Streamlit (UI)  
- 📷 OpenCV (video & image processing)
